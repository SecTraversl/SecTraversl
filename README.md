### Welcome to my IT Toolbox 👋

- 🔭 **I’m currently working on** ... creating tools to automate security operations.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning** ... about some good ways to use Markdown to better showcase some of the tools I have made.
- ⚡ **Fun fact**: ... This site is a work-in-progress.  The tools are tried and tested and I use them on a regular basis, but staging things on GitHub is a new endeavor for me - so as I find more effective ways to package them up and distribute them I will continue to make changes here.
- 😄 **The Toolbox**: ... I have created about 300 Python tools, 500 PowerShell tools, and 70 shell functions as of the end of 2021.  I more than tripled my tool development from 2020.  Often I will create functions or tool wrappers for existing binaries or simple shell capabilities in order to "document" how things are done.  Then when I need build something more comprehensive, I use my categorized functions as a "lookup table".  I have learned and forgotten so many things... but I have discovered that organizing things this way and creating these categorized tools has exponentially increased my retention and operational ability.
